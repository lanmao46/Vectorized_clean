# Prophylactic Efficacy Predictor Vectorized

This package is used to compute the prophylactic efficacy in vectorized way 
such that the computation can be performed for multiple individuals and dosing schemes 
simultaneously. Currently, it is applicable on DTG, TDF, FTC, Truvada(combination of TDF/FTC), EFV, ISL, LEN and CAB.
